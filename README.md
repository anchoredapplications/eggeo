# Eggeo Instructions for Installation and Usage
Our Nuxt.js app is a geolocation-based Easter egg hunt game. Users can create unique Egg IDs, print QR codes for each egg, and then place the QR codes on real Easter eggs. The app automatically sets the current location for each egg based on the user's geolocation. Other users can then scan the QR codes to find the eggs and earn points. The app includes features for viewing rankings, resetting scores, and authentication using Google OAuth2. With pages for user management, map display, rankings, and scanning, our app provides a fun and interactive Easter egg hunt experience for users of all ages.
